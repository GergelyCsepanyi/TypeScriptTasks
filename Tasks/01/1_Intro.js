    Here are a few statements to understand what this TypeScript is.

        TypeScript is a programming language based on JavaScript.

        TypeScript is a strongly typed and compiled language.
    Although at the output the compiler creates the same JavaScript, which is executed then by the browser.
    However, strong typing reduces the number of potential errors that might occur when developing with JavaScript.

        TypeScript implements many of the concepts that are native to object-oriented languages, such as:
    - inheritance,
    - polymorphism,
    - encapsulation,
    - access modifiers and so on.

        TypeScript makes it faster and easier to write large complex programs,
    accordingly, they are easier to maintain, develop, scale and test than in standard JavaScript
    
        TypeScript develops as an open source project.
    Repository address - https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript.
    In addition, it is cross-platform, which means that we can use both Windows and MasOS or Linux for development.

        TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, which means that any JS program is a TypeScript program.
    In TS, you can use all those constructions that are used in JS - the same operators, conditional, cyclic constructions.

        How to get started with TypeScript?
        You can install TypeScript using npm, the package manager for Node.js (https://nodejs.org/uk/download/).
    After installing Node.js from the official site, npm will automatically appear in the system.
    
    You can read more about installing the TypeScript compiler and using it in Visual Studio Code in the documentation.
/*
        Task
    1) Install TypeScript globally using the command in the console: npm install -g typescript
    2) Check out the article at the link https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling.
    2) Make all the necessary settings and create your first helloword.ts file following the example.
